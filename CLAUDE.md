## Architecture Overview

This is a **CZP Parliamentary Calendar Event Aggregator** built with the oneForAll blueprint framework, **successfully deployed on AWS ECS** with unlimited execution time for Parliamentary calendar processing. The project processes Italian Parliamentary events from Camera and Senato sources, enriches them with OpenAI, and stores them in Neo4j.

### ðŸš€ **Current Status: Production Ready on ECS**
- âœ… **Deployed & Running**: https://czp-event-aggregator-calendar.activate.bar
- âœ… **Unlimited Execution Time**: No 15-minute Lambda limitations
- âœ… **Parliamentary Event Processing**: Camera and Senato calendar aggregation
- âœ… **OpenAI Integration**: Event enrichment and normalization
- âœ… **Auto-scaling**: Fargate containers with load balancer
- âœ… **High Availability**: Load balancer with health checks

### Key Components

**FastAPI Application (`smart_agent/main.py`)**
- Main entry point for the FastAPI application
- Configures CORS middleware with environment-based origins
- Includes routers for: discover, execute, abort, status, logs
- Sets up cleanup handlers for graceful shutdown

**Configuration Handler (`smart_agent/lambda_handler.py`)**
- Detects ECS vs Lambda environment automatically
- Loads configuration from AWS Parameter Store or .env fallback
- Uses Mangum wrapper only for Lambda; direct FastAPI for ECS
- Handles environment variable setup and validation

**Agent Core (`smart_agent/src/agent/base_agent.py`)**
- CZP Parliamentary Calendar Event Aggregator
- Integrates with OpenAI API for event processing and analysis
- Conditional imports for heavy processing modules (ECS vs Lambda)
- Neo4j database integration for calendar event storage
- Webhook notifications for status updates
- Environment mode switching (dev/prod) for prompt handling

**Camera Events Processor (`smart_agent/src/agent/camera_events.py`)**
- Italian Camera (Lower House) parliamentary calendar scraping
- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup and proxy API integration
- Event extraction, date normalization, and OpenAI enrichment
- Neo4j integration for storing Camera events with proper relationships
- Week-based event filtering for current Parliamentary sessions

**Senato Events Processor (`smart_agent/src/agent/senato_events.py`)**
- Italian Senate (Upper House) commission calendar scraping
- Commission URL extraction and individual calendar processing
- OpenAI-powered event processing and multi-event splitting
- Neo4j batch synchronization with duplicate detection
- Target week filtering and date validation

**Configuration System**
- Agent configuration in `smart_agent/src/config/agent.json`
- Environment variables loaded from Parameter Store (AWS) or .env (local)
- Support for different agent types and configurations

**API Routes (`smart_agent/src/routes/`)**
- `/discover` - Agent capability discovery
- `/execute` - Main agent execution endpoint (Parliamentary calendar processing)
- `/abort` - Job termination
- `/status` - Job status checking
- `/logs` - Log file access

### Deployment Architecture

**ECS Deployment (Current)**
- AWS Fargate containers for scalable, long-running tasks
- Application Load Balancer with health checks
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- CloudWatch logging and monitoring
- ECR for container image storage
- Supports unlimited execution time for Parliamentary calendar processing

**Legacy Lambda Deployment**
- 15-minute execution limit (insufficient for full Parliamentary calendar processing)
- S3-based package storage in `533267084389-lambda-artifacts`
- Automatic cleanup of old deployment packages
- Kept for backward compatibility

**DynamoDB Integration**
- Agent-specific tables: `{agent-name}-{environment}-jobs`
- PAY_PER_REQUEST billing mode with status-index GSI
- Complete data isolation between agents and environments

**Environment Management**
- `main` branch â†’ dev environment
- `prod*` branches â†’ prod environment
- All GitHub secrets automatically uploaded to SSM Parameter Store
- Environment-specific IAM roles and policies

### Environment Variables

Required for local development:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API access
- `APP_PORT` - Server port (default: 8000)
- `APP_HOST` - Server host (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `ALLOW_ORIGINS` - CORS allowed origins
- `AGENT_NAME` - Agent identifier
- `AGENT_TYPE` - Agent configuration type

ECS/Lambda-specific:
- `JOB_TABLE` - DynamoDB table name (set by Terraform)
- `PARAMETER_PREFIX` - SSM parameter path prefix
- `ENVIRONMENT` - Deployment environment (dev/prod)
- `ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4` - ECS detection (automatic)

Parliamentary Calendar Processing:
- Neo4j connection credentials (hardcoded in camera_events.py and senato_events.py - should be moved to environment variables)
- OpenAI processing configuration for event enrichment
- Web scraping API tokens for external proxy services

## Development Notes

### ECS vs Lambda Detection
- The application automatically detects if it's running in ECS or Lambda
- ECS provides unlimited execution time, suitable for Parliamentary calendar processing workloads
- Lambda is limited to 15 minutes, kept for backward compatibility
- Heavy processing modules (BeautifulSoup, Parliamentary scrapers) are conditionally imported

### Parliamentary Calendar Processing
- **Camera Events**: Web scraping of Italian Camera parliamentary calendar with proxy API integration
- **Senato Events**: Commission-by-commission calendar extraction from Senate website  
- **OpenAI Integration**: Event enrichment, normalization, and multi-event splitting
- **Neo4j Storage**: Graph database integration with proper Calendar â†’ Date â†’ Source â†’ Event relationships
- **Week Filtering**: Target week-based event filtering for current Parliamentary sessions

### Configuration Management
- Environment mode switching for different behaviors in dev vs prod  
- Prompt files are downloaded dynamically in dev mode, static in prod mode
- All configuration is centralized through Parameter Store in AWS environments
- Local development uses .env files as fallback

### Security and Best Practices
- Neo4j credentials should be moved from hardcoded values to environment variables
- OpenAI API keys exposed in code should be moved to environment variables
- Comprehensive error handling and webhook notifications
- Cleanup handlers ensure graceful shutdown and resource cleanup
- Container security with non-root user in Dockerfile
- All secrets managed through AWS SSM Parameter Store with encryption

### Performance & Scalability
- **Parliamentary Calendar Processing**: Sequential processing of Camera and Senato sources
- **OpenAI Integration**: Event-by-event processing with retry logic and rate limiting
- **Neo4j Batch Operations**: Batch synchronization with duplicate detection
- **Auto-scaling**: ECS Fargate automatically scales based on demand
- **Resource Efficiency**: Pay only for actual usage with Fargate pricing

### Monitoring & Troubleshooting
- **CloudWatch Logs**: `/ecs/agent-czp-event-aggregator-calendar-dev`
- **Health Checks**: Load balancer monitors container health
- **DynamoDB Metrics**: Job state tracking and performance monitoring
- **ECS Service Events**: Deployment and scaling event logs
- **Neo4j Database**: Parliamentary calendar event storage and relationship monitoring
